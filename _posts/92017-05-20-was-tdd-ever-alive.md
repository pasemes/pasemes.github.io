#The origin and the expected benefits of TDD

TDD was re-discovered by Kent Back and throughoutly presented in his famous book "Test Driven Development: By Example".



T EST-DRIVEN Development (TDD) is among the corner-
stone practices of the Extreme Programming (XP)

adopted in industry both as part of a large-scale adoption of
XP and as a stand-alone practice.
