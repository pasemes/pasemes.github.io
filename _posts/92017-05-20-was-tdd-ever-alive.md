#The origin and the expected benefits of TDD

TDD was rediscovered by Kent Back and thoroughly presented in his famous book "Test Driven Development: By Example". It was initially put among the cornerstone practices of the Extreme Programming (XP) development process, but it became so popular that was adopted as a stand-alone agile practice. In a period when software testing was regarded as something for mature organizations performed usually at the end of lengthy releases, the rediscovery of TDD was an important instrument to support the introduction of some agile principles emerging at the time.  The basic idea attributed to TDD is to provide a continuous feedback regarding the current state of your development process in terms of the source code design improvement and defects expectancy reduction. As a result, TDD is extremely useful for several agile practices particularly those concerned with the short iterative nature of agile methods such as welcoming changes, maintaining a constant pace, and assessing the progress of working software. For this reason, its main expected benefits are:

* Work with confidence;
* Work on a series of achievable steps instead of tackling a big problem all at once;
* Ensure that software design meets the need of the actual code;
* Leave behind a suite of tests to help preserve the integrity of the code.

Despite the improvements associated with TDD, there are several possible drawbacks which are seldom discussed. Most of them are concerned with two main aspects: *testing before code* and the design aspects associated with it by the means of *refactoring*. The level of *automation* in terms of testing coverage is also a target of discussions. Those drawbacks remained hidden for several years mostly because of the religiosity to which most developers devoted to the so-called "red-green-refactor cycle." It was not up until 2014 that David Heinemeier posted in his blog the article entitled [TDD is dead. Long live testing](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html) which is to the best of my knowledge the first with a great prestige in the open source community to touch this subject.
