Did you know that you are subject to the evidence-based practice (EBP) whenever you visit a doctor? Have you ever wondered why you are (usually =) so confident that your physician has the right treatment for you? Implicitly, it seems that all of us assume that the treatment is selected based on one or more (factual) reasons for believing that it will have positive effects on our illness. Not by chance, this is precisely the definition of evidence[^1].

Isn't that interesting? We expect that physicians base their practice on evidence, but we in the software community seem to prefer to whether a practice brings *happiness* or a framework provide an elegant solution for a problem. Not that these aspects aren't important, but you got the point. I have never met a software developer (outside the academic circle) that is aware of the (EBP). If you are one, please leave a comment! I would be glad to know who (and how many) you are.

The notion of EBP dates from the beginning of the 1990s in the Medicine discipline. In 1990 Dr. Gordon Guyatt introduced a new concept called "Scientific Medicine" to describe a new method of teaching medicine at the bedside, using the critical appraisal techniques from Dr. David Sackett. One year later the term "Evidence-Based Medicine" was coined in the ACP Journal Club Editorial[^2]. Since them the 







Critics claim that EBM lacks utility on several levels. Some claim that it transforms the complex process of clinical decision makingwhich includes data gathering, years of medical knowledge, experience, and astute intuitioninto an algorithmic exercise that is not individualized for specific clinical scenarios and therefore subject to error in patient care



It makes sense, don't it?
