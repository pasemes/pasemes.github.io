# A little bit of history

Did you know that you are subject to the evidence-based practice (EBP) whenever you visit a doctor? Have you ever wondered why you are (usually =) so confident that your physician has the right treatment for you? Implicitly, it seems that all of us assume that the treatment is selected based on one or more (factual) reasons for believing that it will have positive effects on our illness. Not by chance, this is precisely the definition of evidence[^1].

Isn't that interesting? We expect that physicians base their practice on evidence, but we in the software community seem to prefer to argue about whether a practice brings *happiness* or a framework provide an *elegant* solution for a problem. Not that these aspects aren't important, but you got the point. I have never met a software developer (outside the academic circle) that is aware of the (EBP). If you are one, please leave a comment! I would be glad to know who (and how many) you are.

The notion of EBP dates from the beginning of the 1990s in the Medicine discipline. In 1990, Dr. Gordon Guyatt introduced a new concept called "Scientific Medicine" to describe a new method of teaching medicine at the bedside, using the critical appraisal techniques from Dr. David Sackett. One year later the term "Evidence-Based Medicine" (EBM) was coined in the ACP Journal Club Editorial[^2]. The basic idea of EBM is to bring more certainty to clinical decision making. Before EBM, "clinical practice was historically viewed as the 'art of medicine.' Expert opinion, experience, and authoritarian judgment were the foundation for decision making. The use of scientific methodology, as in biomedical research, and statistical analysis, as in epidemiology, were rare in the world of medicine."[^3] Looks familiar, eh?

Since its proposal, EBM received huge attention. The term was then generalized from EBM to EBP. And several fields have adopted EBP aiming at improving its decision-making process such as Administration, Nursing, Marketing, and, of course, Software Engineering. In our case, EBP was brought in 2004 by Barbara Kitchenham and her colleagues in the International Conference on Software Engineering[^4]. Still, even though this was the first mention of EBP in Software Engineering, which was then denominated Evidence-Based Sofware Engineering (EBSE), the field promotes the evidence (through experimentation) since 1978. The general research topic under which experimentation and evidence are investigated is called Empirical Software Engineering.  

# Evidence-Based Software Engineering

Ok, so now that you know the origin of EBP and what it is about, it is time to understand how EBP can help our field to get out of the fashion-oriented industry to a real engineering field. 
The EBP is about asking the right question (to search for the evidence available). Thus, instead of look for the hype of the moment, EBP should enable us to seek for the reasons for believing that a software development technology will provide the support we expect from it. In

Critics claim that EBM lacks utility on several levels. Some claim that it transforms the complex process of clinical decision making, which includes data gathering, years of medical knowledge, experience, and astute intuition into an algorithmic exercise that is not individualized for specific clinical scenarios and therefore subject to error in patient care

# My criticisms: why EBSE isn't widely adopted by software engineers?
