So you are wondering what this blog is about. What is that thing called "evidence-based practice" that is supposed to be useful for me (a software engineer). You do not know, eh? 

Unfortunately this is true for the vast majority of professionals in our area. For us the role responsible for indicating which technology[^1] we should be using in our projects is denominated software evangelist. Yes, it a matter of faith when or what software development technology we should be using.

At this point you are probably thinking: "I do not follow these guys! Who still follow them?". Ok, it is my perception too that their influence is declining. However, the presence of "gurus" is still pervasive. Conferences are full of specialists and experts with a vast repertoire of practices and a broad variety of tools ready to be applied in software projects. This ranges from the more soft parts of development, such as process and practices, to the more hard side like tools and frameworks. Take the Agile Software Development as example. It was proposed by a bunch of guys telling us how software should be developed. At least, they were indeed clever and knowledgeable, and experience can be considered a kind of evidence. We will discuss what should be considered evidence in a minute. 






[^1]: I refer to software technology as any practice, tool, technique, process, method, or methodology related to software construction.
