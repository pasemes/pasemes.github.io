So you are wondering what this blog is about. What is that thing called "evidence-based practice" that is supposed to be useful for me (a software engineer). You do not know, eh? 

Unfortunately this is true for the vast majority of professionals in our area. For us the role responsible for indicating which technology we should be using in our projects is denominated software evangelist. Yes, it a matter of faith to use a software development technology[^1].






[^1]: I refer to software technology as any practice, tool, technique, process, method, or methodology related to software construction.
