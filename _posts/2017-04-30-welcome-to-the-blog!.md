So you are wondering what this blog is about. What is that thing called "evidence-based practice" that is supposed to be useful for me (a software engineer)? You do not know, eh? 

Unfortunately, this is true for the vast majority of professionals in our area. For us, the role responsible for indicating which technology[^1] we should be using in our projects is denominated software evangelist. Yes, it is a matter of faith when or what software development technology we should be using.

At this point, you are probably thinking: "I do not follow these guys! Who still follow them?". Ok, it is my perception too that their influence is declining. However, the presence of "gurus" is still pervasive. Conferences are full of specialists and experts with a vast repertoire of practices and a broad variety of tools ready to be applied in software projects. As one can see, this ranges from the softer parts of software development, such as process and practices, to the harder side of tools and frameworks. Take the Agile Software Development as an example. It was proposed by a bunch of guys telling us how software should be developed. At least, they were indeed clever and knowledgeable, and experience can be considered a kind of (weak) evidence. We will discuss what should be considered evidence in a minute. In the tools and frameworks arena, the problem is the same. Who needs yet another javascript (or any other language) framework[^2]? 

One interesting analogy used to illustrate the current situation in our industry is the "fashion-driven development"[^3]. The idea is that if you are not using the very latest practice, technique, framework, or tool, then you are **wrong** (to put in simple terms). Again, this translates the reality of several conference talks, blog posts, podcasts --- you name it. One thing that particularly annoys me is how frameworks are described. Here are a few (I omit the names to test your memory, I'm pretty sure that you are going to remember some of them):  "the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines"; "...is a powerful web framework, for the Java platform aimed at multiplying developers productivity"; "A framework for creating ambitious web applications"; "The XXXXXXX Framework For Web Artisans". Well, you got the idea. 

> In summary, software development technologies are created (and adopted) without any kind of evidence of its needs and usefulness.  


[^1]: I refer to software technology as any practice, tool, technique, process, method, or methodology related to software construction.
[^2]: a.k.a. Yet Another Framework Syndrome (YAFS).
[^3]: I'm pretty sure that I've read/heard this on several other occasions. In a quick search I was able to find these two discussions ([here](https://dzone.com/articles/dogma-driven-development) and [here](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/fashion-driven-development/)).
